# Matlatzinca
Matlatzinca is GUI for dependence modelling. The program can be used to schematize a Non-Parametric Bayesian Network and define the (conditional) rank correlations. The results is a correlation matrix, that can be used as dependence model. The program is suitable for expert elicitation, as it (i) provided a simple interface for defining a BN, and (ii) helps the user with the mathematical details of defining a valid correlation matrix.

The software is based on the python module py_banshee, which can be found [here](https://github.com/mike-mendoza/py_banshee). Note that this module is described in https://doi.org/10.1016/j.softx.2022.101279, and is based itself on an MATLAB version of the code.
